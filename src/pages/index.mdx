# Home



The majority of ABI survivors cannot work and have to rely on state benefits and, of course, many are cared for by family or friends. A number also have physical disabilities which further reduce their quality of life. Many suffer from loneliness, which was made worse by lockdown, and most cannot afford holidays and for some, holidays are beyond their physical abilities.

# Who we are


The Trustee Board is made up of the following:

|      Name        |         Position      |
| :--------------: | :-------------------: |
| Trevor Hines     | Chairman and Trustee  |
| Robert Aylott    | Treasurer and Trustee |
| Sandy Simpson    | Secretary and Trustee |
| Catherine Toplis |        Trustee        |
| Rosie Wilson     |        Trustee        |
| Glynis Wood      |        Trustee        |

There are no staff and none of the Trustee are paid.

# What are we aiming to do

FABIS was formed to provide holidays and social events for ABI survivors to improve their mental health, interact with others and give them hope for the future. We generally do not consider applications from ABI survivors under 18 and over 60.

# How we help

We, as a Charity, give a grant to allow ABI survivors to have a holiday in the UK and we organise social events within West Sussex. If required, carers can accompany the ABI survivor on holiday and to social events but may have to make a contribution to the cost.

Obviously, the levels of funding for holidays will take into account the applicants financial situation but this does not preclude self funders from going on the holidays where possible. The charity also offers free and subsidised social events too.

# How are we funded

Starting with a grant from the Anne Merriman Trust, FABIS is entirely funded by donations and fundraising events FABIS is a small charity and with no staff and no overhead costs. So all our income goes to supporting ABI survivors.

# How ABI survivors go about applying for a holiday

There is an application form ready to download on this website or if this is difficult to do then ABI survivors can apply via their support group coordinator or the mobile phone number for FABIS.

# Organising a social event

Let us know via an individual, a support group coordinator, or any other charity/partner.

# Fund-raising events

See drop down list?
